          Hi! I’m the heart and hands behind this little bakery dream.
          Ever since I was a child, I’ve been enchanted by the warmth of ovens,
          the magic of rising dough, and the joy a simple pastry can bring.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting this bakery has been a long-held dream — not just a business, but a personal journey of turning passion into purpose.
          After years of baking for friends and family, experimenting with recipes, and imagining the space where people would gather to share a sweet moment, I finally decided to take the leap.
        </p>

        <p>
          This bakery represents more than cakes and bread — it’s a reflection of my belief in creating comfort through food, offering something handmade, personal, and filled with care.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every item is made fresh, with thoughtfully sourced ingredients and attention to detail — whether it’s a flaky croissant, a rustic sourdough, or a custom cake for someone’s big day.
        </p>

        <p>
          My hope is that this bakery becomes not just a place to grab a bite, but a space that feels welcoming, inspiring, and just a little magical.
          Thank you for being a part of this dream.
        </p>
